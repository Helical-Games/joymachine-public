# PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE.
... Apparently something [**like this**](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) is what this should be. And, if this project was that size, that thing would be helpful.

But that's a lot of guidelines and writing. So, if you want to contribute, just *do it* without fear or hesitation. 

We're always looking to expand what's here to make it a more useful resource for folks.
