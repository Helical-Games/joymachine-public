# Contributing to [joymachine-public](https://github.com/joymachinegames/joymachine-public)

We don't care to own the rights or exclusivity or anything of that nonsense in this repo; we just want to provide as many tools, scripts, assets (that are legal to distribute), source code, and links/articles/advice/resources for game development -- though we tend to focus on Unreal Engine 4 specifically.

If you'd like to toss anything in here, we absolutely encourage it. We always give attribution to anything that wasn't internally developed, and you're welcome to remove whatever you contribute if you ever desire to do so.
